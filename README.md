LaserQuest Game
==========

LaserQuest is a puzzle game about light interactions. I've always been facinated by puzzle games so I decided to try my hand at making one. One of the goals of this project was to build it in such a way that I could easily add more features and levels in the future.

I built this in Action Script 3 as an excerise to experience the Flash world. Since AS3 is very similar to Java this wasn't too steep of a learning curve. With Flash clearly out I will most likely be porting this to Android when I get some time. It was built to decouple the Flash related logic with the majority of the code, so the task of porting it isn't as steep as it could have been.
